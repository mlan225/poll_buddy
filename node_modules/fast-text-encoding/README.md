This is a fast polyfill for [`TextEncoder`][1] and [`TextDecoder`][2], which let you encode and decode JavaScript strings into UTF-8 bytes.

It is fast partially as it does not support any encodings aside UTF-8 (and note that natively, only `TextDecoder` supports alternative encodings anyway).

# Usage

<<<<<<< HEAD
Install as "fast-text-encoding" via your favourite package manager.

You only need this polyfill if you're supporting older browsers like IE, legacy Edge, ancient Chrome and Firefox, or Node before v11.

## Browser

Include the minified code inside a `script` tag or as an ES6 Module for its side effects.
It will create `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` if the symbols are missing on `window` or `global.`

```html
<script src="node_modules/fast-text-encoding/text.min.js"></script>
<script type="module">
  import './node_modules/fast-text-encoding/text.min.js';
<<<<<<< HEAD
  import 'fast-text-encoding';  // or perhaps this
  // confidently do something with TextEncoder or TextDecoder \o/
</script>
```

⚠️ You'll probably want to depend on `text.min.js`, as it's compiled to ES5 for older environments.

## Node

You only need this polyfill in Node before v11.
However, you can use `Buffer` to provide the same functionality (but not conforming to any spec) in versions even older than that.

```js
require('fast-text-encoding');  // just require me before use
=======
  // confidently do something with TextEncoder \o/
</script>
```

**Note**: Always include `text.min.js`, as it's compiled to ES5 for older environments.

## Node

Install via NPM or Yarn (name "fast-text-encoding"), and then import purely for side effects:

```js
// don't need to save this anywhere, just require before use
require('fast-text-encoding');
>>>>>>> 7667619318f2e7e4ad64e58abdc3812448859fd9

const buffer = new TextEncoder().encode('Turn me into UTF-8!');
// buffer is now a Uint8Array of [84, 117, 114, 110, ...]
```
